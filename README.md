An implementation of an exercise from chatper 13 of "Programming Elixir":

>“In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides hourly XML feeds of conditions at 1,800 locations.[24] For example, the feed for a small airport close to where I’m writing this is at http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KDTO.xml.
> Write an application that fetches this data, parses it, and displays it in a nice format.”
